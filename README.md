Phonepe Data Visualization project 

This project aims to visualize data collected from PhonePe, a popular digital payments platform, using Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort.

Overview
PhonePe generates a plethora of transaction data ranging from payment trends to user demographics. Analyzing and visualizing this data can provide valuable insights into user behavior, transaction patterns, and market trends.

Features
Interactive Visualizations: Utilize Streamlit's interactive components to create dynamic and user-friendly visualizations.
Data Exploration: Explore various aspects of PhonePe data such as transaction volume, transaction types, user demographics, and more.
Insightful Analytics: Generate insightful analytics to understand user behavior, identify popular transaction categories, peak transaction hours, etc.
Customization: Allow users to customize visualizations based on their preferences, such as date range selection, transaction types, geographical analysis, etc.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Streamlit: Web framework for building interactive data applications.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization libraries for creating static plots.
Plotly: Interactive visualization library for creating dynamic and interactive plots.
SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL: Database systems for storing and querying PhonePe transaction data (optional, depending on project requirements).
